number sexual offspring will remain generation male female require reproduce
asexual condition will increase frequency generation
despite twofold cost sex maintain animal species reproduce asexually

contrast asexual reproduction expect advantageous stable favorable environment perpetuate successful genotype faithfully precisely
number reason unique gene combination form sexual reproduction advantageous
beneficial gene combination recombination speed adaptation
idea appear straightforward theoretical advantage rate beneficial mutation high population size small
idea shuffling gene sexual reproduction allow population rid set harmful gene
experiment test hypothesis ongoing laboratory

animal conserve resource reproduce sufficient energy source store environmental condition favor survival offspring
example ewe female sheep reproductive cycle lasting 1517 day
ovulation release mature egg occur midpoint cycle
ewe cycle generally occur fall early winter length result pregnancy 5 month
